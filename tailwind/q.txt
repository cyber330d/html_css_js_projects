Nkwobi is a Nigerian delicacy usually ordered and enjoyed in exclusive restaurants. It is simply cooked cow foot mixed with spicy palm oil paste.

Ingredients
Cow feet
Salt, to taste
Seasoning cubes
1 large onion, chopped
Ugba (optional)
Potash
Palm oil
Ground crayfish
Ground Cameroon pepper, to taste
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
Sliced utazi leaves
Sliced onions
Equipment
Stove
Pot
Knife
Wooden bowl/serving plate
Procedure
Cut the cow feet into small pieces, and remove all the bigger bones.
Place the cow feet in a pot, along with the salt, seasoning cubes, and chopped onions.
Add just enough water to cover the meat. Simmer until the meat is tender. Add small amounts of water as necessary, but there should be little to no liquid left in the pot once the meat is done.
In a separate pot, boil the ugba separately for just 3 minutes. Drain.
Dissolve the potash in a cup of water, and strain it into a separate pot. Add the palm oil to the potash water, and stir well until thick and yellow.
Add the crayfish, boiled ugba, Cameroon pepper, seasoning cube, and salt to the palm oil mixture. Stir well.
Add your cooked meat, and stir to coat with the palm oil mixture.
Serve in a wooden bowl with toppings of round-cut onions and sliced utazi leaves.
